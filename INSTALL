1. COMPILING and INSTALLING

To compile and run URONode you will need to have libax25-0.0.4 or newer
installed on your system. It should work on any platform where libax25 can
be compiled and installed. 
Note however that it will NOT work with 2.0.x kernels.

To install you should first run:

  ./configure

and answer to the questions it makes. 

** IF ** this is an ** UPGRADE **:
and if you said no to configure running a "make", just type:
make; make installbin
This will *not* overwrite your config files, and will freshen up
your binaries only. If you told the configure script to make, then
all you need to type to upgrade is: make installbin.

** IF ** this is a new install:

If all files needed are present everything should work. Next:

  make (if you said "no" to the configure script launching it for you)
  make install
  make installhelp

Optionally you may want to run also:

  make installconf

to install the default configuration files. 
Note however this copy example files in /etc/ax25 but with ".ex". 
You should rename it by removing ".ex" at the end of filenames.

After that you need to edit the configuration files to suit your system. 
The manual pages for node.conf(5) and node.perms(5) should give an idea 
of what to put into these files. The AX25-HOWTO is a must read also.

2. RUNNING

URONode is intended to be called from ax25d or inetd. It doesn't need
any command line arguments. See the node(8) manual page.

To run URONode from ax25d, /etc/ax25/ax25d.conf should have something
like this in it:

  # AX25 Port ax0
  [N1URO-2 VIA ax0]
  default  * * * * * *  -    root  /usr/bin/uronode  uronode

  # NETROM Port
  <nr0>
  default  * * * * * *  -    root  /usr/bin/uronode  uronode

/etc/inetd.conf could have something like this in it:

  # Listen at telnet port -> URONode
  telnet  stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/bin/uronode     uronode

Note that URONode should always be run as root. Otherwise outgoing
connects won't work. Also ping needs a raw socket which requires root
priviledges.

URONode can also be called from command line. It then uses kernel
axassociation table to find a call associated to the user. Again
for outgoing connects (and ping) to work URONode needs to be
installed setuid root (make install does that by default).
