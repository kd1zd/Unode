Welcome to the official FAQ file for URONode.

The purpose of this file is to help explain better about URONode and what
the various features were designed for. Since this file will be maintained
via URONode Sysop reports, I'll consider this file a constant 'work in
progress' type file.

When using URONode or really any other linux node flavor, keep in mind
that the actual node program itself is only a front-end for the users
to do various functions your linux server may have to provide. Node really
doesn't do any sort of control features whatsoever, it merely acts as a
sort of proxy to your linux daemons. Those features are toggled on/off at
compile time by the operator of the node. I've taken time to rework the
configure script to give the node ops more flexibility in what they wish
to service their end users with. Nothing about URONode was ever designed
as a 'replacement' for any existing services such as email and convers.
I'm not even going to suggest one chooses to run URONode as a replacement
for LinuxNode by Tomi, AWZNode, or even FlexNode. The goals I set when
starting this project were moreso to custom fit my unique setup and its
something I can share with the amateur community at the same time.

URONode is NOT:
A replacement for *NOS
A replacement for Email
A replacement for PBBS
A replacement for convers
A FlexNet router

URONode IS:
A user front-end with some additional features to help compliment those 
existing features an end user may need but for whatever reason doesn't
have access to at the moment, while allowing links to various entities
such as AX.25 links, Net/Rom routing, FlexNet destinations, general and
amprnet TCP/IP services.
