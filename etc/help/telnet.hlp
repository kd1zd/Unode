USAGE
        Telnet <host> [<port>] [s|d]

DESCRIPTION
        Initiates a telnet session to a remote host using TCP/IP.
        You might not be able to connect to a given host due to the
        local operator's policy of using this node, or simply because
        the host is unreachable due to a network failure. You can use
        the ping command to check if a host is reachable.

        By default, the telnet command connects to the TCP port 23
        (allocated for telnet). You can specify another TCP port or
        a TCP port name.

        If a single `s' is entered as the last parameter, then when
        the remote host disconnects you will be returned to this node.
        If a single `d' is entered as the last parameter, you will
        be disconnected from this node too. Default behaviour (neither
        `s' nor `d' entered) depends on sysop configuration.

EXAMPLES
        telnet aripisa.ampr.org
        telnet aripisa.ampr.org 1024
        telnet 44.134.208.29
