USAGE
        PIng <hostname> [<length>]

DESCRIPTION
        Checks if a host can be reached trough the network by sending
        an ICMP Echo Request packet to the host and waiting for it to
        reply. If a reply is received the round-trip-time (RTT)
        between the local and remote hosts is shown.

        If an optional length is specified the data portion of the
        packet is filled with length number of bytes.

EXAMPLE
        ping aripisa.ampr.org
