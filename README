Unode 1.0.0  

This node is originally based on UROnode 1.0.7, which was based on the work of several other hams.  You can read
the history in README.URO.  

This version is known to compile on the Linux 2.6.x series of kernels.  The versions of AX25 libraries I used
to compile this were:

libax25-0.0.12-rc2
ax25-tools 0.0.10


Please let me know if you have suggestions to make the program better, bug reports, etc.

Thanks,
